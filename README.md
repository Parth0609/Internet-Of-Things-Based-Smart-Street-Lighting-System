# Internet-Of-Things-Based-Smart-Street-Lighting-System

Project Overview 
1. INTRODUCTION: The present Lighting system on roads is like a menage 
lighting system i.e., once the lights have been turned on, they will stay on until or 
unless someone switches back the switch and turns them off manually, regardless 
of whether someone is present inside the room or not (vehicles on the road in this 
case). In the traditional system the lights are turned on before the evening and they 
stay on until next morning, staying on for the periods even when there are no 
vehicles on the road. This system also requires significant manpower. In the 
proposed model all manual operation is eliminated alongside saving energy 
consumption.


2. PROBLEM STATEMENT: Today, India is the fifth largest energy 
consumer in the world. While the planet consumes 12000 million tonnes of oil 
equivalent (MTOE) of energy resources, India consumes 4.4% of the planet’s total 
(524.2 MTOE). India is Ranked 104th in per capita electricity consumption index 
among the whole world. Despite being a heavy energy consumer a large part of 
India’s energy comes from non-renewable sources. As of March 2019, India 
produced 75.38 % of its total energy production using non-renewable sources 
(substantially Fossil Energy). Coal alone accounts for 86.78 % of electricity 
generated in FY20. Still a Large part of this energy is wasted every year due to 
traditional switch-based street lighting system. Old street lighting systems account 
for around 6-7 % of the total 20.66 % of energy losses in the country. 
Another aspect of the problem is loss of infrastructure. Reports indicate that the 
average lifespan of Argon Bulbs and Halogen Lamps is significantly reduced by 
around 10 percent due to nonstop operation in the traditional street lighting 
systems. These problems can lead to significant losses of a country(s) 
infrastructure. 
Power saving is a matter of concern because natural sources of power are getting 
diminished due to unregulated usage and various other reasons.


3. PROJECT OBJECTIVE: The street lighting is one of the largest energy 
expenses for a city. An intelligent street lighting system can cut municipal street 
lighting costs as much as 50% - 70%.This project proposes a IOT application, 
designed specifically to solve the power wastage pro. This application provides an 
IR sensors-based System where the lights can turn on and off on their own, 
without any human guidance depending on the time of the day, Weather, and 
Intensity of the traffic on the road where system is enforced. Here the system had 
to be made to be able to identify any vehicle or pedestrian on the road and work 
accordingly. 
Secondly the system had to be made more and more effective, so we have used a 
minimalistic approach by using n similar smaller systems on a single road patch 
rather than using a single system for a long road lowering the functional costs of 
the system. However, the onetime implementation cost of system will increase due 
to usage of more sensors, but again it will be beneficial in case of system or device 
failures. The whole system won’t be impaired in case of a faulty sensor sparing 
the inconvenience and repair costs.
